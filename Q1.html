            Q.1 What is jQuary? <br>
            Ans:- jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. <br>
            It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, <br>
            animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a <br>
            multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery  <br>
            has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. <br>
